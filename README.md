# Movie-Recommendation
Movie recommendation using SVD is a collaborative filtering method that decomposes the user-item matrix to identify hidden patterns in user preferences. It captures latent factors to provide personalized movie suggestions, making it effective for handling sparse data and improving recommendation accuracy.
 
- Decomposes user-item interaction matrix into latent factors  
- Identifies hidden patterns in user preferences and behaviors  
- Captures both user and item characteristics  
- Provides personalized movie suggestions based on past ratings  
- Handles sparse data efficiently by approximating missing values  
- Reduces dimensionality of large datasets for faster computations  
- Enhances the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms  
- Can recommend movies even for users with few ratings  
- Utilizes mathematical optimization to minimize error in predictions  
- Helps uncover relationships between different movies and users  
- Accounts for factors like genre, user taste, and rating patterns  
- Frequently used in recommender systems like Netflix and Amazon  
- Improves recommendation diversity by detecting subtle preferences  
- Allows for continuous updates with new data or user activity  
- Provides scalable solutions for large user bases  
- Can be combined with other techniques, like content-based filtering  
- Addresses cold-start problems by filling in missing user-item interactions  
- Effective for long-term user engagement and satisfaction  
- Widely adopted in modern recommendation engines due to efficiency
